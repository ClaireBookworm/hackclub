# Generative Art!
*a workshop by Claire Wang [@clairebookworm](https://twitter.com/clairebookworm1)*

A workshop for those who are too lazy to draw 'em lines themselves. Uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and works with an online browser compiler (no downloading required). You can find the editor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/)!
